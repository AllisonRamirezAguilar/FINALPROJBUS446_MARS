Initially, we decided to do our graphs through Excel. We concluded that our data was too big and could not be interpreted correctly.
We would have to reduce our data or move our raw data set into Tableau.
We ended up going for tableau and being able to interpret all of the crime rates from 2000 - 2013 given in the data set.
